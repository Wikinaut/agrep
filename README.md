AGREP - an approximate GREP. 

Fast searching files for a string or regular expression, with approximate matching capabilities and user-definable records. 

Developed 1989-1991 by Udi Manber, Sun Wu et al. at the University of Arizona.

For Glimpse and WebGlimpse - AGREP is an essential part of them - see

Usage
=====

Type

    agrep

to get the six built-in help pages.

```
           Approximate Pattern Matching GREP -- Get Regular Expression
Usage:
AGREP [-#cdehi[a|#]klnprstvwxyABDGIRS] [-f patternfile] [-H dir] pattern [files]
-#  find matches with at most # errors     -A  always output filenames
-b  print byte offset of match
-c  output the number of matched records   -B  find best match to the pattern
-d  define record delimiter                -Dk deletion cost is k
-e  for use when pattern begins with -     -G  output the files with a match
-f  name of file containing patterns       -Ik insertion cost is k
-h  do not display file names              -Sk substitution cost is k
-i  case-insensitive search; ISO <> ASCII  -ia ISO chars mapped to lower ASCII
-i# digits-match-digits, letters-letters   -i0 case-sensitive search
-k  treat pattern literally - no meta-characters
-l  output the names of files that contain a match
-n  print line numbers of matches  -q print buffer byte offsets
-p  supersequence search                   -CP 850|437 set codepage
-r  recurse subdirectories (UNIX style)    -s silent
-t  for use when delimiter is at the end of records
-v  output those records without matches   -V[012345V] version / verbose more
-w  pattern has to match as a word: "win" will not match "wind"
-u  unterdruecke record output             -x  pattern must match a whole line
-y  suppresses the prompt when used with -B best match option
@listfile  use the filenames in listfile                              <1>23456Q
```

Branches
========

The present repository contains three different branches:

* **master**: agrep based on agrep 3.0, ported to OS/2, DOS and Windows in the 90ies, and backported to LINUX (the present version you are visiting)
* **agrep3.0-as-found-in-glimpse4.18.6-20130216**: agrep 3.0 as it was found in the glimpse software
* **agrep2.04**: the first published and original agrep version


Installation
============

```
git clone git@github.com:Wikinaut/agrep.git
cd agrep
make
```

Alternatives to AGREP
=====================

[Alternatives](http://www.tgries.de/agrep):
* TRE is a lightweight, robust, and efficient POSIX compliant regexp matching library with some exciting features such as approximate (fuzzy) matching. 
* AGREPY: Python port of agrep string matching with errors
* The bitap library , another new and fresh implementation of the bitap algorithm. Windows - C - Cygwin
* PERL module String:Approx. Perl extension for approximate matching (fuzzy matching) by Jarkko Hietaniemi, Finland
* ugrep https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep

Further stuff with the same name (agrep)
========================================

* [aGrep](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.sblo.pandora.aGrep&hl=de), published in 2012, is an Android implementation of ```grep``` (but not ```agrep```).
