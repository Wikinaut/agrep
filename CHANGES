3.41  20040531 TG The versions AGREP 3.41 for LINUX, AGREP 3.37 for Windows 95/NT, AGREP 3.35 for OS/2 and DOS
                  are based on the AGREP program from GLIMPSE 3.0.
                  Many bugs have been identified and I regard my version as the most tested and debugged version of all AGREP versions 
                  I found until 31.05.2004. However, the core from which I started is extremely diffcult to read (apart from understanding)
                  and lacking descriptions. However, my port never crashed in all the last eight years.
3.0               Agrep version 3.0 as in GLIMPSE 3.0
