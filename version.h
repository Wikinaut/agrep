[fix]	3.35	TG 11.12.97	in agrep(): -f now working again
				prepf() for multi-pattern was called
				before the codepage LUT was prepared
[fix]	3.34	TG 22.10.97	in mgrep(): check bounds before memcpy()
[chg]	3.33	TG 07.04.97	when no target filename(s) were given:
				AGREP displays an error message now

				When one uses "AGREP <needle> *" and there are
				no files in that subdirectory,
				the 3.32 has waited for stdin (=haystack, target).

				under Windows or OS/2
